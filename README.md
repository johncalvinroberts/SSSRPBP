# SSSRPBP
**S**uper **S**imple **S**tupid **R**eact **P**rototyping **B**oiler**p**late

The name says it all. A thin starter/boilerplate with all of the configs I like, to start coding React stuff without having to spend time on config. Very few dependencies, just a solid dev workflow foundation, meant to be deconstructible for when an app gets more complex.

### Dependencies
* react & react-dom
* react-router-dom (v6, in alpha stage at the time of writing this)
* eslint
* prettier
* parcel bundler

### Getting Started
* Run `npx sssrpbp --name=<name of your app>` (or copy the files from `template/default` in this repo)
* `yarn`
* `yarn start`
* To build - `yarn build`
* Start writing code of questionable integrity.

**Note**: This starter is just meant for __prototyping__, if you have actual production-facing business requirements to address, you should probably go for a different solution.
