# SSSRPBP
**S**uper **S**imple **S**tatic **R**eact **P**rototyping **B**oiler**p**late

A thin starter/boilerplate with all of the configs I like, to start coding React stuff quickly. Very few dependencies, just a solid dev workflow foundation, meant to be deconstructible when an app gets more complex.

Statically generated for super fast TTI and SEO. Sometimes, [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) is a tad bit overkill when you want something quick and simple.

### Dependencies
* react & react-dom
* eslint
* prettier
* [parcel bundler](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel)
* [react-snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap) for static prerendering

### Getting Started
* Run `npx sssrpbp --name=<name of your app>` (or copy the files from `template/default` in this repo)
* `yarn`
* `yarn start`
* To build - `yarn build`
* Start writing code of questionable integrity.

**Note**: This starter is just meant for __prototyping__, if you have actual production-facing business requirements to address, you should probably go for a different solution.
